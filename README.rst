Umap2
=====

Umap2 will be the second revision of Umap,
the USB host security assessment tool.

Until we move it to NCC Group's repository, it will stay here.

The code is not ready for release at all!
The only executable available right now is **bin/umap2_runner.py**
which is not the final runner script,
but it lays out the basics on how to implement more features.
The only thing that is actually implemented in umap2_runner.py
at the moment is device emulation for some devices.

The **FEATURES.rst** file contains lists of implement and missing features.

The **TODO.rst** file contains general TODO list for Umap2.

**NOTE**

This is an experimental, non-release-in-any-way, code.
Use at your own risk.


Happy hacking,
Binyamin
